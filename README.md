# Graphed-Jar-Problem
The problem of the 3 and 4-liter jars, also known as the water pouring problem or the measuring jug problem, is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves two empty jars, one with a capacity of 3 liters and the other with a capacity of 4 liters, and a water source.

The goal of the puzzle is to use the jars and the water source to measure out a specific quantity of water, typically a certain number of liters. The challenge is to figure out how to use the jars to measure out the desired quantity of water using only a limited number of pours, without wasting any water.

The problem can be made more complex by introducing additional constraints or variations, such as the jars being irregularly shaped or having leaky lids. The problem has practical applications in fields such as engineering, chemistry, and physics, where accurate measurements of liquids are required.

## To solve the problem of the 3 and 4-liter jars, there are several operations that can be applied, including:

Filling a jar completely with water.
Emptying a jar completely of water.
Pouring the water from one jar into the other jar.
Partially filling a jar with water.
By combining these operations in different ways, it is possible to measure out specific quantities of water using the 3 and 4-liter jars. For example, one common solution to the problem involves the following steps:

Fill the 4-liter jar completely with water.
Pour the water from the 4-liter jar into the 3-liter jar until the 3-liter jar is full, leaving 1 liter of water in the 4-liter jar.
Empty the 3-liter jar completely.
Pour the remaining 1 liter of water from the 4-liter jar into the empty 3-liter jar.
Fill the 4-liter jar again with water.
Pour enough water from the 4-liter jar into the 3-liter jar to fill it completely, leaving 2 liters of water in the 4-liter jar.
Empty the 3-liter jar completely.
Pour the 2 liters of water from the 4-liter jar into the empty 3-liter jar.
The 3-liter jar now contains the desired quantity of water (2 liters), and the 4-liter jar contains 1 liter of water.
By applying these operations in a systematic way, it is possible to solve the problem of the 3 and 4-liter jars and measure out specific quantities of water with a high degree of accuracy.
